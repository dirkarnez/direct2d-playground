### Notes
- [Graphics Device Interface - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface)
  - > Direct2D is the successor of GDI and GDI+
  - > Its sibling, DirectWrite, replaces Uniscribe
- [Direct2D - Win32 apps | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-portal)
  - > Direct2D is a hardware-accelerated, immediate-mode, 2-D graphics API 
  - > Direct2D API is designed to interoperate well with GDI, GDI+, and Direct3D.
- Mingw64 seems not working for linking properly to Direct2D
  - [[Mingw-w64-public] direct2d functions work with C++ API, but not with C API | MinGW-w64 - for 32 and 64 bit Windows](https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/mailman/message/37417555/)
